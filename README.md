    ● On one of the pages, (kind of a reference page) create a form that lets others
     add your skill and its rating (a mechanism where someone you know tells something
     about you). It may be preferred to use drop down here. Use an array and a
     dictionary to store this data.Display it in the form of a table on the same
     webpage. Store 4 attributes (name of the person who is adding the skill, the
     skill, its level). Level: {Proficient, Intermediate, Beginner}.
    ● The first row means that John says you are intermediate in HTML with a comment.
    ● Display a set of 5 images that change on clicking the image (The next image 
     should be shown only on clicking the current image). Also, clicking 5th image
     should lead to 1st image.
    ● Create a visitor tracker for the page which counts the number of visits that has
     been made to your website. The tracker should work for the home page only.
